# "Foodie Delight"
...except they are United States-based as I have yet to explore other countries. Perfect for foodies!

## Overview

I wanted a way to display and add some of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at, whether they are fast food or fine cuisine or something in between. I'm pretty forgetful so having this visual data and the ability to add to it will have me wanting to revisit or just remember the delicious meal I had.


## Project Requirements

This is a single-page app made with ==create-react-app==. There are 12 components with four routes using React Router. I created a mock API with some data I input using my own experiences and references from the internet, specifically restaurant photos. A GET request is made to display the restaurant data in cards and a POST request can be made if a new restaurant card is to be added.

## Project Goals

Eventually, I would like to build upon this app and make a more complex reviews page as well as deploying it. It would also be cool to make the Contact page fully functional and receive any feedback from someone who visits the page and submits info.
